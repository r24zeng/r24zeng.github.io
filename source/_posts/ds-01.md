### Distributed System basic idea
    This means clients send request to servers, servers send response back to clients. But it is the model that many clients to deal with many servers.

### Overlay
+ Structured:
  + Each node knows all neighbours
  + If query comes, the node responds to this query or ask its neighbour who stores the answer directly
 + Unstructured:
   + Each node only knows one neighbour 
   + If query comes, the node responds to this query or ask its neighbor, its neighbor will do same thing until respond to this query
   
### Coherent System
+ Every node works at the same way, you see lots of machines just like see one mechine working. 
+ When you send a job request, you don't know which node accepts it and how they work on it, just get the reply from anynoe node

### Midlleware: the OS of distributed systems
+ RPC -- allows invocation of a remote function as if avalible locally
+ Communication -- allow nothing effect
+ Sensitive composition -- web pages that combine and aggreagate data from different sources that are distributed
+ Reliability -- eg. group comminucation

### Sharing resources
+ Canonical examples
  + cloud-based shared storage and files
  + peer-to-peer assisted multimedia streaming
  + shared mail services (think of outsourced mall systems)
  + shared Web hosting (think of content distribution networks)
  
### Distribution transparency
#### Types
+ Access (hide deep layers to users)
+ Location (access the source of different locations, get response from which server)
+ Relocation (reloacate some source from one server to another one)
+ Migration (eg, redirect the link to another, different)
+ Replication (web browser, cache, for quick response)
+ Concurrency (many usrs at the same time, such as buying the same stuff in Amazon)
+ Failure (make copy of data, so even if fail we can't feel, it recovers immidiately)
### Degree of transparency
#### Observation (chanllenges and costly)
+ communication latency can't be hidden
+ storage cost, sometimes need many replicates, sometimes don't need
+ transaction, send request and is executed by server but fail to send back response, or send request and the server fails before execute
+ reload cost, in order minimize lost, store everyghing and reflesh them in Disk during every reloading but not into meomery directly
#### Exposing distribution may be good
If the server is slow or fails can be known
### Policies of mechanisms
+ how frequently check status of node
+ when grap more data from users and when deliver response
