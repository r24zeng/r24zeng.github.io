# This is my blog
### My personal web link is: [https://www.runruning.cn](https://www.runruning.cn)
### My web github repository is: [https://github.com/r24zeng/myweb](https://github.com/r24zeng/myweb)
### My blog link is: [https://r24zeng.github.io](https://r24zeng.github.io)
### My blog github repository is: [https://github.com/r24zeng/r24zeng.github.io](https://github.com/r24zeng/r24zeng.github.io)

### Some information about this blog:
Tools: Mac terminal, gitpage, hexo, hexo themes, npm, node.js

Theme: [Chic](https://github.com/Siricee/hexo-theme-Chic), this is a very clean and excellent design. However, there is no comment, share, like functions. I hope I can develop it.

This folder is located at mystudy/hexo folder in my local computer. Below are some useful **hexo commands**.

Problem: 
+ cache on client makes fresh deploy hard, after I typed `hexo d -g` in terminal, my blog didn't refresh except clearing web history. 
+ When I run the above command, my whole github repository is fresh, and README.md witten in this repository has also gone. It's not so firendly. Which means, I can't edit on github directly, such as writting new page. It's a problem I should solve in the future.

`Hexo + Gitpage` teaching resource can be found everywhere online.
