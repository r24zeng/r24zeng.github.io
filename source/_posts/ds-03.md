### Three types of distributed systems
+ High performance distributed computing systems
+ Distributed information systems
+ Distributed systems for pervasive computing 

### Parallel computing
Hight-performance distributed computing started with parallel computing, multiprocessor and multicore versus multicomputer

Two memory mechanisms:

+ shared memory (multiprocessor and machines, they send request to interconnect bar, then get the memory)
+ Private memory (every machine and processor pair is a big machine and access others' memory indirectly)

Good example is that one machine is the entry and connects to other machines parallelly.

### Grid computing (remote server)
Access to remote machine easily.

### Cloud computing (eg, AWS is No.1 cloud serviser leader)
+ application (eg, gmail, Google is No.1 application leader)
+ Platforms (eg, .net , LAMP stack)
+ Infrastructure (eg, Virtual CPU, AWs is No.1 leader)
+ Hardware

Virsulization makes cloud computing sucessful. Elasticity is necessary for scalability because sometimes load and resources go up or demande and resources go down, such as sleep wake cycles.

### Integrating applications
Distributed system decide which task should go to which server is more beneficial (different requirmens)

Transation processing: There is monitor between client and server to assign jobs.
