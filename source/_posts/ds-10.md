kernal space: not easy to change anything

user space: all aplication space

Don't want to write or open file in kernal sapce, because it may mess up the kernel. Recent 5 years, people do research in **fuse** to develop DFS in user space, and how to impove the performance and user abilities. We can use any ptotocal to communicate between client and server. But in thess assignments, we use RPC. 

### Assignemnt 2: 4 parts

+ implement WatDFS functions (watdfs_client.c)
