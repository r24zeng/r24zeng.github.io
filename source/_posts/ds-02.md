### On strict separation
### Observation
**Finding a balance**

Hard coding policies ofen simplifies management and reduces complexity at the price of less flexbility. There is no observe solution

**User -> load; H/M resources**
+ Scale up
  + If you want add more resource but not enough memory so that add more machines(servers)
+ Scale out
  + Distance is too long so as to add more servers to work togerther

**Technology application**
+ hiding communication latency
+ distribut work replication (and caching)

**Practical problme**

If one server takes heavy requests and we add another server, how to assign new commming request to make requests balance? Check load bound of servers in each second and send request to right server.
